### Hi there 👋

(●'◡'●) About me

🧒
I am current MSCS student at the University of San Francisco. 
    I has a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master's degree in Business, which means I has a interdisciplinary background. Machine learning was a major field, and now I am also good at Full-stack development.
    I am finding an software development internship in Summer 2023. Thank you for spending time on reviewing my profile!
